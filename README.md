# DeepDives

Simple app to see what the current deep dives are. I made this because I was annoyed with how long Reddit took to load, and I'd rather not look at JSON.

Installing this is a pain in the ass, since MS requires an actual trusted certificate for MSIX. I literally can't be bothered to pay for that for this.
