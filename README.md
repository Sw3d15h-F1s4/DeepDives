# DeepDives

Simple app to see what the current deep dives are. I made this because I was annoyed with how long Reddit took to load, and I'd rather not look at JSON.

Installing this is a pain in the ass, since MS requires an actual trusted certificate for MSIX. I literally can't be bothered to pay for that for this.

# Installing

Go to releases and download the `DeepDives.zip` file. Extract the folder somewhere you like, open, scroll down, and run `DeepDives.exe`.

Sorry in advance for the ridiculous folder structure. Microsoft is delusional if they think MSIX/WinUI3 is feasible for solo devs or quick projects.
